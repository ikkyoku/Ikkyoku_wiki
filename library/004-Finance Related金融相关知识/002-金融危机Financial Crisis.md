##### public safety  
  
### Conflict of interest  
  
### Common dilemma in Finance  
  
#### Sunshine versus secrecy  
  
##### If executives and regulators disclose the problem publicly, it will stop, but it could erode public trust and cause a run in the short term.  
  
##### If they don’t disclose it and hope it resolves itself, it could become a bigger, costlier problem that will erode trust even more and cause a more drastic loss of confidence.  
  
#### When a firm face trouble  
  
#### Example  
  
##### Reagan S&L crisis  
  
##### Subprime crisis  
  
## Perennial Concept  
  
### Moral Hazard  
  
#### Private gain, socialize risk  
  
##### Example  
  
###### Bailout of thrifts/executives  
  
##### Depositor  
  
###### Indifferent to whether the banks holding their money were well run  
  
##### Manager  
  
###### Encourage sloppiness  
  
###### Risk down  
  
##### Executive  
  
###### Risk rise  
  
#### Shoot the moon  
  
### Slippery Slope  
  
#### Losers take bigger and bigger risks—and increasingly have nothing to lose by doing so—to try to make up for past losses or rising obligations  
  
### Sunshine versus Secrecy  
  
#### Make the bank’s problems public and thus stop it from continuing to cause harm but possibly spark panic that would aggravate the situation short term  
  
#### Say nothing and, though not upsetting the public now, allow the problem to fester and almost certainly grow worse and costlier to fix.  
  
### Speculative  
  
#### No good underwriting  
  
### Easy Credit  
  
#### Too much money chasing too few good investments  
  
##### Federal deposit insurance/depositor  
  
###### Counterweight:Regulatory apparatus  
  
#### Necessary but insufficient for a bubble  
  
### Supervision versus Regulation  
  
### Race to the bottom  
  
#### As regulators, whose budgets depend on fees from those they regulate, adopt looser and looser rules to entice banks to switch from federal charters to state charters or vice versa.  
  
### Lender of last resort/confidence/liquidity  
  
### Liquidity versus insolvency  
  
### Fine line central banker walks as lender of last resort  
  
### Too big/essential to fail  
  
#### Protect any bank whose demise would threaten the financial system and hence damage other banks and financial institutions.  
  
## 1929  
  
### Great Depression  
  
#### Key reason  
  
##### Retail installment credit  
  
###### Buy now pay later optimism  
  
##### Stock-market investing by general public on margin  
  
###### People are more risk-adverse for their own money  
  
##### Easy credit  
  
##### Few rules, little oversight  
  
##### Greatest disparity in wealth  
  
#### Response  
  
##### Federal deposit insurance  
  
###### Moral Hazard  
  
##### Level playing field  
  
##### More market oversight

###### Bank regulators bolstered

###### Federal Savings and Loans Insurance Corporation(FSLIC)  
  
####### Insure deposit at thrifts  
  
##### Codify doctrine separating commercial banking and commerce  
  
##### Cap on interest rate  
  
###### Banks/Thrifts with federal deposit insurance could offer depositors  
  
#### Federal Reserve  
  
##### Three Main Federal Bank Regulators

####### Prudential regulators  
  
######## Safety and soundness regulators  
  
######### Against systemic risk  
  
####### Consumer protection regulators  
  
##### Goals of regulators  
  
###### Protect the system  
  
###### Protect deposit insurance fund  
  
###### Protect taxpayers  
  
##### Central bank of U.S.A.  
  
###### Monetary policy  
  
###### Keeper of economy  
  
###### Bank regulator  
  
##### Mistake  
  
###### Not regulate the market to take money out of the system during 1920’s  
  
###### Get money out after crash  
  
###### Not set interest rates and curb risky bank practices before and after the crash
