# BI Power to Help build bridge between Business and Technology



CVAA Team has done many researches on how to imply Tableau onto our projects.

We believe that we don't just view BI tools as data dashboards. On top of that we should fully understand the business and our technology, then combine these two things, to apply agile development for business requirements, and help users acquire insightful data effeciently.



 Here are the 4 aspects that we use Tableau to build up bridge between tech&business.

1. **Integration with web**
   - In traditional data system, user can only see sum-up data in certain hierarchy, and cannot get down to details rapidly. They need to download raw detialls and analysis using softwares like excel which takes times. This process of data analysis is low-efficiency ,complicated.
   - We integrated tableau workbook link in the web app.When User is  searching data, they can instantly jump to tableau drill down page with the same hierarchy and filters. Then they can know the data details immediately. They can also keep drill down or go to other level of data .
   - Benefits: For development team,  save time and resources on develop front-end pages. For users, they have the flexibility to directly analysis on tableau pages.
2. **DB Performance Research**
   - We have done various tests on Tableau connection with different DBs supported in Citi.
   - Based on our research Hive with impala driver works best for big data projects due to its faster loading speed and responding ability.
   - provide support and help to project developmentw                              
3. **Data Explanation**
   - For projects with complex calculating logics, it's hard to trace back data and make the whole calculating process transparent.
   - We use the data process ability in Tableau to design a Tableau worbook showing how certain output data is calculated. 
   - Also this can help to check the calculation in the projects ,and help users to trace back input when they see abnormal data ranging, using it to find the reason why change happens.
4. **Analysis Dashboard**
   - we design several data dashboards for projects to help users monitering the trend of data, and help them to do quick analysis.enchance their business insights

Our purpose of importing this tech is to have a better interactive way for users to deal with the data

Not only drill down and sum up data from tech side, but also effciently provide business data to users and pass down valuable business insights.
